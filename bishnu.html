<h2 style="color:brown;">Get around</h2>
<p>By cycle rickshaw because it is a small place. Many of the temples are near each other. Most are within walking distance of one another. Cars and auto-rickshaw are also available on hire.
</p>
<h2 style="color:brown;">See</h2>
<p>Bishnupur being a temple town, the focus is on temples, all built of terracota during the reign of the Malla kings, who ruled over the area prior to the arrival of the British. Please note that Archaeological Survay of India (ASI) maintains most of the sites of Bishnupur. So it levies a minimum entry fee for the sites. The amountis Rs 5 for Indian citizens and Rs 100 (Probably) for foreigners. It also levies a fee for video photography (still photography is free). The good thing is that with a single ticket, one can visit all the sites of Bishnupur maintained by ASI. The counter is located near the entrance of Rash Mancha. So it is better to start from Rash Mancha. The sights other than temples are also listed below:
</p>
<h2 style="color:brown;">Temples</h2>
<ul><li> <b>Jorbangla Temple</b> of Keshta Rai - Built by King Raghunath Singha Dev II in the 17th century. The ornate terracotta carvings are set off by the roof in the classic chala style of Bengal architecture.</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Nandalal Temple</b></li>
<li> <b>Radhamadhab Temple</b></li>
<li> <b>Kalachand Temple</b></li>
<li> <b>Radhagovinda Temple</b></li>
<li> <b>Sarbamangala</b></li>
<li> <b>Shyamrai Temple</b> or Pancha Ratna Temple of Shyam Rai - Built in 1643 by King Raghunath Singha. The walls are richly decorated with terracotta carvings featuring aspects of Lord Krishna’s life. It is one of the largest temples.</li>
<li> <b>Krishna-Balaram Temple</b></li>
<li> <b>Mrinmoyee Temple</b></li>
<li> <b>Radhashyam Temple</b></li>
<li> <b>Madanmohan Temple</b>- King Durjana Singh Deva built the temple in 1694 AD in the ekaratna style, a square flat-roofed building with carved cornices, surmounted by a pinnacle. Impressive carvings on the walls depict scenes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Puranas.</li></ul>
<h2 style="color:brown;">Other places</h2>
<ul><li> <b>Rasmancha</b> - Oldest brick structure. Built in 1587 by Bir Hambir is a pyramidal structure in the centre of the town, where the deities from the other temples are brought in a procession on the occasion of the Rasa Festival. There are some cannons of the Malla kings in the area.</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Dalmadal Caman</b> - supposed to have protected Bishnupur when the Bargis (Maratha looters) attacked from the west. </li>
<li> <b>Lalbandh</b></li>
<li> <b>Gumgarh</b> - the place of no return. </li>
<li> <b>Pathar Darja</b> (Main Gateway of Bishnupur)</li>

<li> <b>Stone Chariot</b></li>
<li> <b>Nutan Mahal</b></li>
<li> <b>The memorial of Shreenibas Acharya</b></li></ul>
<p>Most of these awe inspiring and wonderful work of art in terracota have been lost out of sheer neglect, antique theft and vagaries of the weather over centuries. Some are protected and cared for now and protected as noticed. It is best to hire a rickshaw and go about visiting them as nearly all are within a diameter of 4 kms. Takes about 3 hours to see most of them. Ideal time to visit would be during the cooler climes as generally Bishnupur is a hot place and was pretty uncomfortable during a visit Aug '12 though there was moderately good rainfall.
